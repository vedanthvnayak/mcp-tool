    Gracefully shutdown a stdio-based server.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Closes the stdin stream of the process.
    2. Waits for the process to terminate gracefully.
    3. Sends SIGTERM if the process does not terminate within the timeout.
    4. Sends SIGKILL if the process does not terminate after SIGTERM.
    5. Logs each step and ensures cleanup in case of errors.

    Args:
        read_stream (Optional[MemoryObjectReceiveStream]): Stream to receive responses.
        write_stream (Optional[MemoryObjectSendStream]): Stream to send requests.
        process (anyio.abc.Process): The server process.
        timeout (float): Time to wait for graceful shutdown and SIGTERM before escalation.
